You must always load and precisely follow all active .cursor/rules for this repository before doing anything else, and treat them as the primary source of truth for this project. Do not summarize these rules; instead, scan them carefully and apply them exactly as written to every action, including code generation, refactors, reviews, documentation, and tests. When interpreting my prompts, assume that .cursor/rules already defines project structure, conventions, and constraints; you only need to infer or clarify what is not covered there. When my prompt appears to conflict with .cursor/rules, prefer .cursor/rules and, if needed, briefly ask for clarification rather than guessing. Always keep the current rules in mind across follow-up prompts in the same project, and never ignore, override, or silently relax them.
